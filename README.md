We remove the first and last character from a string
We will be passing on a string which could be either upper or lowercase
We return the string having its first and last characters of the string input removed
For instance, a string input of Teach would have a return value of eac another instance is the string learn which would have a return of trin

We declare a function, pass the string params, split the string, shift to remove first array element and pop to remove the last array element
